**Hi, I'm Michael De La Guera** 👋

**AI Solutions Architect & Technical Product Lead**

I bridge the gap between rigorous Enterprise Compliance (Title 31/NIGC) and Modern Software Architecture.

I specialize in building Vertical SaaS platforms, AI Agent Orchestration, and High-Throughput Data Pipelines. My work focuses on solving "boring" but critical business problems—like digitizing 100-year-old newspapers or automating federal regulatory audits—using cutting-edge tech (Next.js, n8n, Vector DBs, Blockchain).
